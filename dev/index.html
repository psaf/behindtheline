					<h3>Community YouthMapping&#8482;</h3>
					<p class="text-justify">
						Community YouthMapping (CYM) is themapping of resources, priority issues, partners and opportunities in the community. Through this process youth learn how to collect, analyze, share and present data toward impacting outcomes. CYM has also facilitated the identification of opportunities for employment, education, training, internships, healthy food choices, and many others. The CYM training begins with the personal and professional benefits for youth and moves through the day to day skills and responsibilities using a variety of small and large group activities. Ultimately the youth gain skills in public speaking, data collection, data presentation and develop a strong grasp on their own roles and responsibilities in making CYM a success.
					</p>

					<h3>Youth Engagement</h3>
					<p class="text-justify">
						 Youth Engagement is the intentional provision of opportunities for youth to be engaged in community/youth development. Successful youth engagement can develop leadership skills in youth, educate youth on priority issues, increase the courage and desire to "get involved", and solidify a strong lifelong connection between youth and the community. Youth Engagement training identifies the most common issues for youth in the community and explores barriers and facilitators for youth engagement. Through training youth develop a practical plan to engage themselves and others, while empowering them to making positive change in their community.
					</p>

					<h3>Youth Leadership</h3>
					<p class="text-justify">
						 Youth Leadership focuses on the development of necessary skills for youth to successfully transition to adulthood. These skills includeself motivation, desire for self improvement, recognition of individual and community needs and resources. Youth Leadership training takes youth on a journey that identifies personal and community needs and begins to identify practical plans to address them. Through training youth gain confidence in their own skills, learn how to work in teams, and identify areas for self improvement.

					<h2 class="text-center">Curricula for Youth</h1>
					<p class="text-justify">
						CRC Consulting can also develop numerous types of education and programming for youth. Our Consultants have years of experience in youth programming for diverse groups and projects. All of our adult training, including webinars and online materials, can be adapted for youth audiences and there are specific youth options below. All of our education is highly experiential and intoeractive to ensure engagement and participatory learning.
					</p>
					<h3>Consulting for Youth Programs</h3>
					<p class="text-justify">
						Sometimes you have an existing idea or project but need the right expertise to facilitate the delivery. Or you may need help in the planning stages to ensure that you get off to the right start. We have consultants and programmers who can help you to meet your program outcomes from project initiation to closing. Organizations have brought us in to help with developing programs for culturally diverse groups, or to incorporate equity perspectives into existing programming.
					</p>
					<h3>Youth Leadership</h3>
					<p>
						The most general and comprehensive of our youth programming is the development of leadership modules or sessions that can be incorporated into existing programming or curriculum or as standalone segments. We work with schools, youth groups, non-profits and other public institutions like law enforcement to help connect their programing to the diverse youth communities they interact with and serve. Possible Themes:

						<ul>
							<li>Conflict Transformation</li>
							<li>Communication Skills</li>
							<li>Facilitation skills</li>
							<li>Community Development</li>
							<li>Responding to Discrimination</li>
							<li>Discrimination Response</li>
						</ul>

						We provide specific training using youth-based approaches and pedagogy to ensure participants have a strong capacity to deal with discrimination effectively, safely and with confidence.
					</p>

					<h3>Bias and Stereotype Awareness</h3>

					<p class="text-justify">
						With a constant media and information stream, youth are exposed to thousands of messages and ideas every time they log onto a computer or pick up their smart phone. How do they sort out the negative and harmful from the accurate and fair? Now more than ever youth need to build skills around media literacy and the science of bias and this session engages youth in a conversation about stereotypes and bias and their impacts.
					</p>
					
					<h3>Arts Based Programming</h3>

					<p class="text-justify">
						We can help design and deliver youth programming using arts based approaches from theatre to visual and media arts.
